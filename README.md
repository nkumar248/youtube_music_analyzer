## Description
(IN PROGRESS) I wrote a script that downloads a specified audio clip from YouTube using yt-dlp, extracts chord and timing information from the .wav file using madmom and visualizes the information using pyplot. I wrote this script because I was playing guitar and would have liked to know the chord progression of a music clip in a YouTube video. 

## More ideas
- Create a better visualization
- Extract and display more information about the audio
- Create more user-friendly interaction than command-line usage
