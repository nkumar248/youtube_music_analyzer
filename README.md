## Description
(IN PROGRESS) I wrote a script that downloads a specified audio clip from YouTube using yt-dlp, extracts chord and timing information from the .wav file using madmom and visualizes the information using pyplot. I wrote this script because I was playing guitar and would have liked to know the chord progression of a music clip in a YouTube video.
